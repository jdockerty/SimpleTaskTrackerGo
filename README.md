# Simple Task Tracker - Go

_Small app for learning Golang, idea was taken from the Kubernetes/Docker repo, but done in a more code involved way._

Application stores tasks in JSON format to the file provided, this may have been simpler to do with a map data-type but provided
a great excerise in handling JSON and using structs.

The .exe can also be added to your environment variables by referencing the `.bat` file, this means you can invoke the app to run from the command line using `%ttgo%`, this is what I chose, or whatever you choose to name the variable.
